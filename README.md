Includes:

* Follow Button
* Pin Widget

A "Pin It" Button widget is *not* included in this plugin and is instead included in the separate ["Pin It" Button plugin for WordPress](https://github.com/pderksen/WP-Pinterest-Pin-It-Button).

Embed code is taken from the [official Pinterest widget builder](http://business.pinterest.com/widget-builder/).
